1. document.getElementById("something").elements.length;
--> So if there are many elements with that Id then it will give you the length that means basically how many are there.

2. document.getElementById("something").innerHTML = "Something that i want";
--> THis will change the inner HTML for that ID field

3. const para = document.createElement("something");
--> para.innerHTML = "Something that i want".
--> document.body.appendChild(para) > will append in the DOM tree.
--> similarly removeChild, appendChild, replaceChild and write

4. var p = document.querySelectorAll('p')
--> Access one or more elements from the DOM that matches one or more CSS Selector

5. document.getElementById("something").setAttribute("class", "democlass").
--> Will add attributes to existing fields or elements

6. <h2 onclick = "this.innerHTML = 'Oooops!'">Click on this text</h2>
--> will change the innerHTML for this tag only

7. <input oninput="upperCase()"></input>
--> when user will input in the field the upperCase function will be triggered and in that we can apply any logic that we want

8. onload and onunload events are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.

9. document.getElementById("something").addEventListener("Click", myfunction).
--> basically it will insert event like onclick to that element and myfunction will be like what to do after Click
