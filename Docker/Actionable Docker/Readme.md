1. Basically This actionable docker can be used to run things locally. for example like you want to run postgres locally and for that you would have to install postgres and bunch of other steps which is little bit complex. So instead of that we can use Docker and run it locally in no time.

2. Currently out of service for Docker practicals dues to laptop restrictions

3. Just like we push code in github we can push images in docker registery
